WCA Scoresheets predictor

First model:
	- Predict Event
		- 3x3, 2x2, 4x4, Pyraminx, OH
	- Predict Round
		- Round 1, Round 2, Round 3
	- Predict ID box
	- Predict +2s
	- Predict Misc

Second to sixth model:
	- Predict minutes, 10th seconds, seconds, 100ms, 10ms
	- Result boxes with classification
	- 0-9, DNF, DNS, Extra, Empty

Seventh model:
	- PyTesserAct, PaddleOCR or TfOCR to read people and competiton names.

Postprocessing:
	- Merge predicted result boxes into WCA result

 Annotations:
 	- Event, Round, Id, Misc, +2, Result boxes as annotations
 	- Contents of results boxes from WCA website
 	- Python script to prepare everything

Todo/Ideas:
	- Increase IoU threshold during evaluation
	- Structure folders for CI/CD
		- Make class of file: filename, comp, traintest, results, functions to get digits, to evaluate result
	- During eval, assign weights to each class based on number of present objects. (maps in train.py)


Models necessary:
	- One to predict boxes just for labelling
		- Round, Event, Id, Result, +2, Misc, Missing signature
	- One to predict classes from scoresheet:
		- Round, Event, Id, +2, Misc, Missing signatures
	- Five to predict Result
	-
